A composer ready package designed to integrate the fantastic Font Awesome icon set into your PHP projects through an easy to use interface.

Created with Laravel in mind, a ServiceProvider and Facade have been included as well. Don't worry though, the library will work in any PHP application, via composer or manually.

Install
=======
First, add the package to your main composer.json file:

```json
"khill/fontawesomephp" : "1.1.*"
```

Next, run composer from the command line to download and install:

```bash
$ composer update
```

If you are using Laravel, add the ServiceProvider to the service providers array
```php
'Khill\FontAwesome\Laravel\FontAwesomeServiceProvider'
```

Last, add the link in your view's page header to the FontAwesome CSS file, provided by BootstrapCDN:

```php
FontAwesome::css() // Or FA::css() if you want to use the alias
```
